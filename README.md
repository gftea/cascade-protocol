# cascade-protocol
Rust implementation for Cascade information reconciliation protocol for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

The work is based on [Cascade-CPP](https://github.com/brunorijsman/cascade-cpp) and [The Cascade information reconciliation protocol](https://cascade-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

# Current status of the implementation

- Only implement the classical cascade protocol
- Focus on testing efficiency and correctness of the algorithm, demonstrating possible limitation
- It stubs away the surrounding dependencies, e.g. communication and parallel computing
